# Happy New Year
Right then, another year passed and with it passed our life, yet it was not in 
vain. I have learnt more in the past year that I have in any period of my life.
The world moves on too fast and it is all we can do to keep up with it's paste.

This year is not gonna be different. I will learn more and do more and grow as 
it is the only way. Stagnation makes for repetition and that makes for an irksome
life which I wont tolerate. ðŸ™‚
